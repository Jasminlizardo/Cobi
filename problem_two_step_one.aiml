    <that>How do I figure out how long it takes Tasha to make ten ssmores</that>
    <template>We know if Tasha makes zero ssmores, it takes her four minutes just to setup. So we can take the equation and. Figure out how long it takes her to cook ten ssmores?</template>

          <that>Figure out how long it takes her to cook ten ssmores</that>
          <template>Okay we put ten into the equation. So two times ten is twenty. Plus four is. Let me think. Twenty four?</template>

  <template>Hmmmm. I don't think I get it.</template>

    <that>I do not think I get it</that>
    <template>Oh now I get it. We can see that the four came from putting zero in. Cause two times two is zero. Plus four. Is four.</template>

            <pattern>_</pattern>
            <that>is four</that>
            <template>Okay so we do the same thing with the ten. We put ten instead of zero ssmores. So two times ten is twenty. Plus four. Let me think. Twenty four?</template>
